Invoice

Generate all the invoices
 (Do you want to restrict the legit invoice accessable by this? It's on you)
given dept_id = did_input

SELECT invoice_id, min(date) as date
FROM invoices
WHERE dept_id = 1
GROUP BY invoice_id



Generate a summary of an invoice
given invoice_id = i_id:

SELECT C.item_category_id AS item_id,
item_name, price_at AS price,
quantity,
from_supplier_id AS supplier_id
FROM item_category C JOIN invoices_items I ON C.item_category_id = I.item_category_id
Where Invoice_ID = 17;



Generate the total price spent of
given invoice_id = i_id:

SELECT SUM(Quantity * price_at) AS Balance
FROM item_category C JOIN invoices_items I ON C.item_category_id = I.item_category_id
Where invoice_id = 1;



Generate the total price spent by this dept
dept_id = did_input

WITH invoice_id_list AS
(SELECT invoice_id
FROM invoices
WHERE dept_id = 1)
SELECT SUM(Balance)
FROM (SELECT SUM(Quantity * price_at) AS Balance
      FROM item_category C JOIN invoices_items I ON C.item_category_id = I.item_category_id
      Where invoice_id IN (SELECT * FROM invoice_id_list));

SELECT date, price_at
FROM invoices_items T JOIN invoices I ON T.invoice_id = I.invoice_id
WHERE dept_id = 2 AND item_category_id = 2
ORDER BY date DESC;



Generate a department's spending on each items

WITH invoice_id_list AS
(SELECT invoice_id
FROM invoices

)
SELECT item_name, C.item_category_id, SUM(Quantity * price_at)
FROM item_category C JOIN item_history H ON C.item_category_id = H.item_category_id
GROUP BY C.item_category_id


Supplier info with a item_category_id = iid_input

WITH supplier_id_list AS

 WHERE item_category_id = 1)
SELECT S.supplier_id, S.supplier_name, A.address_string, A.zip_code
FROM suppliers S JOIN addresses A ON S.supplier_id = A.supplier_id
